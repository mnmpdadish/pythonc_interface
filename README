This repository want to be a tutorial on how to interface 
python with C/C++, although there is only one example with C++.

I present two approaches:
1. "ctypes" refers to the module called ctypes, 
   a very simple and straighforward approach.
2. "manual" refers to the way to code your python extension yourself,
   as described at https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html
   Note that there is small differences for this approach between 
   python2.7 and 3+, hence a different directory for each version.

Every directory contains a simple functionning example.
Compile with make and run with python. The python code have only
be tested with python 2.7 and not 3+.

The shared object library will then be created in the directory
and python will be able to call it.

If someone wants to move the ".so" library away from the working
directory, he must update some environment variable with these commands:

for ctypes:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/so:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

for manual:
PYTHONPATH=/absolute/path/to/your/so:$PYTHONPATH
